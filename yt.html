        <h3>The Bright Side</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            While the only thing you can see on this website is the NFT scams that
            companies and individuals make in order to gain more money,
            there is always a bright side. While people have criticized
            these companies for the scams they pull, there have been others
            that have a bigger voice and a community behind them to raise
            awareness of this. People, like myself learned about the NFT scams
            happening from youtubers and other public figures that are against
            these, and the story behind these Youtubers can be amazing at times.
            Youtubers like <b>KiraTV, Josh Strife Hayes, Upper Echelon Gamers,
                Someordinarygamers, Moist Critical and more </b> have been following
            these stories and criticizing them for their manipulation tactics
            and the way they steal money from people, doing it in an entertaining way at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
            While all the above people deserve their own story about the things
            they do, I can’t personally make them look great in here, the best
            way present them rightfully is to support them and share them to people
            who might find them interesting. So, I’d really recommend the reader to
            check them out and make their own opinion on this matter.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is something though that I personally want to address in this place,
            that I think the reader will find interesting and personally It’s my favorite story of this whole “fiesta
            party”.

        <h3>April 1st 2022
            <hr>
        </h3>
        <p>
            On the first of April these youtubers uploaded a parody video of them dressed up in black pretending to be
            the
            “Dark Brotherhood” and making fun that all this is a conspiracy against these NFT companies in order to
            bring
            them down. This all started out by the founder of Earth 2 calling them out and saying that the youtubers are
            just
            conspiring against Earth 2 in order to make them go out of business calling them as “The Dark Brotherhood”,
            so these
            Youtubers wanted to make fun of the whole situation.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            But this is the least of the things that happened on the 1st of April 2022.
            That day was the end of a specific “7 day challenge”, the founder of Earth 2
            <b>Shane Isaac</b> gave, to the youtuber <b>Callum Upton</b>. Shane gave a list of challenges
            for Callum to complete in 7 days and the reward would be 10.000$, Callum was
            criticizing Earth 2 for scamming and providing nothing to the public for
            the past year they have been working on the project. Callum said he
            could do a better job by himself than the Earth 2 developers, so Shane
            told him to prove it.
        </p>
        <p>And this was the challenge:</p>
        <img style="width: 100%;" src="img/challenge.png">
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size:small">The 7 day Challenge by Shane Isaac</p>

        <p>
            Callum 7 days later delivered, and of course there were conflicts between the communities on who won.
            Callum predicted 2 things before completing the challenge.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shane throughout the 7 day challenge, will start hanging the rules to make it in his favor</li>
            <li>That Calum’s community will support him and Shane’s community will support Earth 2.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Callum was right, this is what happened and because of that, Callum
            asked to have a 3rd party to decide if Callum succeeded the challenge,
            his name was Guidebook Gaming, who is in support of the Earth 2 community, but also
            criticizes it fairly.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size:small">Pictures of Callum (left) and Shane(right) from their 7 day challenge videos</p>
        <img style="width: 40%;margin-left: 90px; " src="img/callum.png">
        <img style="width: 40%;" src="img/shane.png">
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Before I show you what Callum did and if he delivered, I’d like to turn back to Shane and what
            he did in order to frame Callum into failing the challenge. Firsty, Shane had
            already stolen from Callum 30 mins of the challenge because he said “He was online
            when this happened so he saw it”, even though Callum was asleep. Secondly Shane lied that “Callum hired 10
            developers during the 7 days challenge in order to help him with the project”
            even though he had no proof of that, and thirdly, Shane throughout the 7
            days challenge, would change the rules of the challenge, making Callum’s work more difficult each time.
        </p>
        <p>
            If Callum won the challenge, that is up for debating, I cannot say who won but I
            do support Callum and I really believe he won the challenge and the reward,
            but you as the reader can make your own opinion to decide if he won. That's why I suggest the reader to go
            and check Callum's
            video about his challenge in the about us section.
