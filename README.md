#NFT-scam-Log
This is a collections of all of my projects for people to see


This is the NFTscamLog. This is an website I made for my project at my college. By using HTML and CSS I madea website about how NFT companies have been scamming people the past years. This isn't uploaded on the internet because of the use of copyrighted material, however the whole website has been created by me.
