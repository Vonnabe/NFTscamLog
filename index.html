            What is the NFT Scam Log?
            <hr>
        </h3>
        <p>
            The NFT Scam Log is a website that archives the recent rise of the NFT-metaverse industry.
            While making a business surrounding the NFT technology isn’t harmful, the more popular it becomes,
            the more people it attracts. By gaining popularity, many people take advantage of this and find ways to scam
            others
            for money.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why though is it a scam if a company or a person drops an NFT album and sells it to the public? Well,
            that by itself isn’t a scam, what makes it a scam is their promises. Usually, companies will promise people
            that what they are
            doing is “a long time investment” or that what they will deliver is a far more than just overpriced images
            of art NFTs. We will notice that
            companies promise the creation of games, or metaverses from these NFTs, lying to people and often delivering
            nothing or publish
            unpolished products, which are not properly functionable or even good looking.

        </p>



        <h3>
            Home
            <hr>
        </h3>
        <p>
            This website contains a list of NFT projects that I personally consider a scam. Some of these companies
            are still running and promising that what they are doing isn’t a scam, some others delivered something non
            functionable and look terrible, getting criticized for that demanding their money back (and of course not
            accepting refunds), and some others just vanished after they got a good “catch” of money, abandoning their
            projects all together.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can probably notice, on your left side you will find the menu in which some of these companies are
            catalogued and by clicking on one of those, you’ll get information about them.

        <h3>What is an NFT?</h3>
        <hr>

        <p>
            Many might be wondering what is an NFT, or might be confused on what is this website, what am I talking
            about even?
            Of course you can google NFTs and look it up on Wikipedia by yourself, or if you are here, you must probably
            know what
            an NFT is, an by this point, why are you reading this section at all?
        </p>
        <p>
            To put it simply, and in a very short way, NFTs are digital tokes, also called (non-fungible token),
            In which any person can buy on the blockchain. Types of NFT data units may be associated with digital files
            such as photos, videos, and audio. Because each token is uniquely identifiable, NFTs differ from blockchain
            cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. NFT ledgers claim to provide a public certificate of authenticity or
            proof
            of ownership, but the legal rights conveyed by an NFT can be uncertain. NFTs do not restrict the sharing or
            copying of the underlying digital files, do not necessarily convey the copyright of the digital files, and
            do not prevent the creation of NFTs with identical associated files.
        </p>

        <p>
            I, the creator of this website, am Pavlos Koullolli, a mere student in the Metropolitan Collage of Athens,
            and this is my work for the project in my web technologies class. I don’t support the creation of NFTs
            but I can see that the technology has potential in the right hands, I just came across this rabbit hole
            on YouTube, talking about all these scams which got me interested and to be honest, I find entertaining
            to watch. There are stories behind some of these NFTs that are so amusing.
